### Description

**Purpose**

- Showcase work for potential employers
- Share journey to the world as an experienced graphic designer who used to work a lot with front-end developers through the *regularly to be updated journal*.
- As a platform for an ongoing project for me to continuously craft my coding skills (especially scss/css as I found things are not that 'easy' to be implemented â€“ no wonder many developers actually dislike designers ðŸ˜…).
  - E.g. It's challenging to implement the exact positioning or the same exact look as the original high-fidelity mock-up. Hopefully as my skills grow, I revisit the problems and fix them.
  - Front-end web development is more 'dynamic', especially in responsive layout as compared to static graphic design layout â€“Â therefore as a print designer I can truly empathise how hard it is for developing into a website.

**Functionality / features**

- Simple interactive features on buttons and links
- Calming and pastel colors â€“ good for your eyes :-) 
- Originally planned to have a cloud background but had problem with implementing it.
- Contact form for ease of contact and also for personal privacy issues of not exposing the email address to public and scam-bots.
- Sticky navigation for better accesibility. 

**Sitemap**

![Original planned sitemap](https://uc23e5e522bf9d060ea03bb989e9.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/inline/BNN-VIgLEKXX0z12LM2wNd1KDlWi0_3RKAZGXwx8SCk6ej2bDfbrlDTT0Cwm_LZoXt8U7kULY0V20Af64hTHkCJ-86FjztpuvsPcMViWMWvLmefIH_OFqJ9OvIgQSJNra1pfSGpsFlTjLgPmc94N0_sH/file#)

- Original planned sitemap. 
- `work.html` is now postponed â€“ overall number of link pages is still within the requirement, four including `index.html`
- Journal â€“ will have individual pages to the post that is long. Currently it's not available yet.

**Target audience**

- Future and potential employers
- New developers / beginners
- Anyone!

**Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)**

- HTML5 â€“ with *Semantic* tag elements for better accesibility.
- SCSS (*Dart* version, which includes the new module system - `@use` implemented as supposed to `@import` that has been deprecated) â€“ this is useful for other developers to pick up the project. Sass makes the css organised better.
- J-SCRIPT â€“ Only for the ***Font Awesome*** api
- Use of icons for convenient implementation from developer side and also to add aesthetics.
- Google fonts â€“ two fonts: san-serif & monospace
- Light interactivity on buttons and menu. Originally planned to implement more like image change on hover, but things didn't work and I have to put it on hold due to the time constraints.
- Netlify deployment platform â€“ personally I am not ready to deply this to the world as they are exactly as how I wanted it to be! Hence, will purchase the domain name once things are fixed!

### Disclaimer:

- Completion under strict time constrains. It was my mistake to dwell into the ***Tutorial Hell***, a term and common thing I didn't know about until my educator told me about it during my presentation.
- `work.html` was orginally planned to be included, but lack of time to finish it. The project is still within the four pages links requirements including home. 
- This is absolutely not a finish product. As I read more about the issue of being insecure to code  that many new developers are experiencing (hence the ***Tutorial Hell*** syndrome since I started the bootcamp), this project will be an ongoing side-project for me. As I learn more and grow, hopefully I can fix all the issues I face in *scss*, and to craft better and cleaner way of developing the website (that looks great as per my design mock-up!).
