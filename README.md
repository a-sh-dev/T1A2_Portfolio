## Description

### **Purpose**

- Showcase work for potential employers
- Share journey and experience to the world as an aspiring full-stack developer who has graphic design background, and used to work a lot with front-end developers in the past.
- As a platform for an ongoing project to continuously craft my coding skills (especially scss/css as I found things are challenging to be implemented â€“ no wonder many developers actually dislike, and even hate graphic designers for being too 'pedantic' with their design mock-up ðŸ˜…).
  - E.g. It's challenging to implement the exact positioning or the same exact look as the original high-fidelity mock-up.
  - Front-end web development is more 'dynamic', especially in responsive layout as compared to static graphic design layout â€“Â therefore as a print designer I can truly empathise how challenging and more time consuming it is for developing the design into a website. I gain more respect now for Developers!

### **Functionality / Features**

- Simple interactive features on buttons and links
- Calming pastel colors â€“ good for your eyes âœ¨ 
- Images / illustrations. I originally planned to have a cloud background but had problem to sucessfully implement it. Also attempted to create a image change on hover on the profile â€“ this will be revisited.
- Contact form for ease of getting in touch and also for personal privacy issues of not exposing the email address to public and scam-bots.
- Sticky navigation for better accesibility. 

### **Sitemap**

![Original planned sitemap](./docs/images/original_sitemap.png)

- Original planned sitemap. 
- `work.html` is postponed â€“ overall number of link pages is still within the requirement, four including `index.html`
- Journal â€“ may have individual pages to the post that is long.
  - I also intend to have the journal page to mix 'blog posts' and some artworks / design work / photos that I want to publish â€“Â just like an art gallery.

### **Target audience**

- Future and potential employers
- New developers / beginners, especially graphic designers
- Anyone! ðŸ˜€

### **Tech stack**

- **HTML5** â€“ with *Semantic* tag elements for better accesibility.
- **CSS3 through SCSS** (*Dart* version, which includes the new module system - `@use` implemented as supposed to `@import` that has been deprecated) â€“ this is useful for other developers to pick up the project. Sass makes the css organised better.
- **Font Awesome** â€“ third-part api for added UI features, such as the use of icons for convenient implementation from developer side and also to add aesthetics to the website overall look.
- **SVG** â€“ Using `.svg` file type for some of the graphic that I made myself â€“ these files are very small in size and great for keeping the image quality, as vector files won't be pixelated.
- **Google fonts** â€“ two fonts: san-serif & monospace
- **Interactivity** â€“ Light interactivity on buttons and menu. 
- **Netlify deployment platform** â€“ personally I am not ready to deploy this to the world as they are not exactly as how I wanted it to be (yet)! Hence, I may purchase the domain name once things are fixed and improved! (PDF resume is only a placeholder for now)

## Personal Reflections

- It was my mistake to dwell into the ***Tutorial Hell***, a term and a common thing for new developers I didn't know about until my educator told me about it during my presentation.
- This is absolutely not a finish product. As I read more about the issue of being insecure to code  that many new developers are experiencing (hence the ***Tutorial Hell*** syndrome since I started the bootcamp), this project will be an ongoing side-project for me. As I learn more and grow, hopefully I can fix all the issues I face in *scss*, and to craft better and cleaner way of developing the website that hopefully is also organised enough for other developers to pick them up âœ¨ 
- Pleased that I finally able to craft and build my website with codes only. In the past I only built it through the help of *Dreamweaver* ðŸ™ˆ
